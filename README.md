## Hi there 👋, I'm Sujoy.
I'm a Senior at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor studying Computer Science.

I am a Bangladeshi-American who moved to the United States in 2018. Proudly following in my parents' footsteps, I am the second generation in my family to attend college. I am driven by a desire to leverage technology to improve lives, particularly for those facing socioeconomic challenges. My firsthand experience of life in a developing country fuels my motivation to create innovative solutions that can drive positive change. My ultimate aspiration is to secure a leadership role in the tech industry, where I can create meaningful impacts and contribute to building a brighter future, especially for communities similar to my hometown.
